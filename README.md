# School-Project-1
First large school project for C++.  Developed a program that creates a small database, using a binary search tree (BST provided by the professor).

I was responsible for writing the makefile and Film, FilmDatabase, Menu, and Project1 files. The remaining files pertaining to the binary search tree were provided for the project.
